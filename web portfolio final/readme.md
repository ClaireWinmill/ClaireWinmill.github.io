<h3>Name</h3>
<p>Portfolio Website</p>

<br>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This is my responsive Portfolio Website, created for my final project in Responsive Web Design 2 (MTM6201). It is a showcase of my artwork and projects created throughout my time in the IMD program at Algonquin College. There is also information about my experience in Art and Design, and a method to contact me with professional inquiries.</p>
<p>In order to create this website, I have used some of the methods and techniques I have learned in both Responsive Web Design 1 and 2.</p>

<h3>Animations</h3>
<p>Animations used for the "Scroll" Arrow, and the "Back to Top" arrow were used from https://animista.net/</p>
<p>I changed certain parameters within the CSS keyframes for these animations, to have them response to measurements that were fitting for my website</p>

<h3>Overall Experience</h3>
<p>I found grids and flexbox to be particularly useful for this assignment. I used grids in several different areas on my website, set to respond to different browser sizes</p>
<p>I found it to be a rewarding experience to code a full website that was not only completely designed by me, but will also be a very useful too to market myself in the future.</p>

<br>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>I did come across some challenges while doing this assignment, especially in terms of using my grids in certain areas. I mostly found this was an issue in areas that I had used responsive images.</p>
<p>At times, I would also find it difficult to match my website to my mockup exactly, especially while I was resizing my browser- due to the fact that my XD file is set at one size. Therefore, sometimes I would need to adjust my grids to have my website match my mockup, but still not break while I was resizing</p>
